## What It Does

This is a simple plugin that transforms img tags in WordPress posts and pages to img tags that are suitable for use with `lazysizes.js`.

It adds data-src and data-srcset attributes along with the `lazyload` class. 

It allows you to target images by class name or convert all images, and gives you the option to load `lazysizes.js` in the footer with just a checkbox.
